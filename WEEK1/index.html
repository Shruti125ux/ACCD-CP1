        <h1>Welcome to the world of Paper cutting</h1>
        <p>This is a webpage made for Art de Papier.</p>
        <p>Art de papier by Shruti Amritkar is an artspace 
            where I transform simple sheets of paper into living landscapes.</p>
            <p>With meticuluos precision and poetic vision, 
                these paper cuttings add life to the paper.</p>
                <p>Paper cutting for me is not just a medium anymore,
                    it is a story of balance between nature and imagination.</p>
                    <p>Here is a glimpse of the paper cutting artwork. Enjoy!</p>
